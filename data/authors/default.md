Hello everyone!! I have branched out to many different fields in pursuit of finding what I want to do in my life, and it has led me to some crazy adventure that has given me a lot of funny and awkward memories lol 


 -Reasons Why I Started This Blog-

1.	I have wanted to get into writing for some time now, but I don't have a lot of experience. I wanted to try something that I was super interested in and that happen to be Anime. But I didn’t know what format I wanted to write it in, it was either Blogs or Light novels. So, I decided to write a blog first to gain more experience and confidence in my writing then add light novels later.

2.	 I have read many different anime blogs some are really great and some are not so much. But they don’t seem to have everything I want to see about the anime in one place.
So, I thought it would be a good idea to see if I could solve my problem and maybe help others that might be seeing the same problem too.

3.	This is also a good opportunity for me to gain experience in Web development and writing as well.


-Side Note:

Something, I wanted to mention I am going to be keeping this blog less professional and more like a personal blog.
also I'm going to keep it more informative as well I know it’s a bit confusing to be less professional yet still informative. I may change it later on as I gain experience. 


Thank you for reading all of that!! LOL!! I hope you find this blog to be informative on your next favorite anime to watch. If you have any suggestions
on how I can improve this blog or the website please let me know and I will look into it and get back to you for the best response please sent me an
