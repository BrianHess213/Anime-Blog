# Plot

Cid Kagenou was just your average, an everyday boy living in modern-day Japan, but he had a dream - to become a mastermind who could exert power from the shadows! Unfortunately, his dream was cut short when he was hit by a truck and died. But, in a twist of fate, he was reborn in a fantasy world as Cid Kagenou! 
He kept a perfectly mediocre appearance so as not to stand out and continued to pursue his dream of manipulating from the shadows. One day, he stumbled upon an elven girl infected by a mysterious disease, and, with his amazing skills, he cured her! Cid then spun a wild tale about a secret organization called "Shadow Garden" 
that was the only one that could fight the Cult of Diablos, a powerful force that secretly ran the world. The elven girl, now named Alpha, was so inspired by Cid's story that she joined Shadow Garden and began recruiting new members. Little did Cid know; his story was actually true - and he was now involved in a complicated power struggle! 
But, with his enthusiasm and determination, Cid was sure to succeed in his mission!

# Main Characters

## Cid Kagenou
The protagonist is the son of a noble family, but he's so much more than that! He's actually been reincarnated from another world after being hit by a truck and dedicating his previous life to being stronger than a nuclear bomb! But don't worry, he's still got his cool factor! He's secretly the leader of the Shadow Garden, an organization that fights in the shadows against the Cult of Diablos, but he believes it's all just a game of pretend. He's determined to act like an NPC character and blend into the background, but his grandiose delusions keep getting in the way - he just can't help but do whatever looks coolest!

## Claire Kagenou
Cid's older sister is a total badass! She's a skilled spell sword user and she knows it! She's always pushing Cid around and giving him a hard time, but deep down she really loves him. She's always ready to throw a punch or two if she gets annoyed, but she'll also do anything to protect him. She's even gone so far as to absorb Diablos and become its host! But Cid just thinks she's role-playing.

## Alexia Midgar
This princess is a real firecracker! She's determined to make Cid's life a living nightmare - and she's not afraid to show it! Even though their relationship was just an act, she couldn't help but fall head over heels for him. But Cid? He was ready to call it quits! She's also one of the few lucky ones to have seen the mysterious 'Shadow' in action - but she has no idea that it's actually Cid! 

## Iris Midgar
She assembled an elite squad of warriors to protect the peace from any and all threats, whether it's Shadow Garden or the Cult. She's won't let anyone mess with her mission to keep her sister and Kingdom safe!

## Rose Oriana
The Princess of Oriana has made a bold move and is now attending the prestigious Midgard Spellsword Academy! She's already making waves, as her swordsmanship is second only to the first princess of Midgar, Iris Midgar! But that's not all - she's also taken up the role of student council president.
